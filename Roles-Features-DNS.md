# Roles and Features - DNS Configuration

## Objective
The objective of this section is to implement Domain Name System(DNS) services on the server to resolve hostnames

## Procedure
In my installation I have already install DNS services and would not need to go through the process of adding a Role and Feature. Whilst on the dashboard
, I would drop down the Tools menu and select DNS as shown below
